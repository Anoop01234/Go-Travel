# Go-Travel Website
Our project â€œAdvance Intelligent Tourist Guide'' is an umbrella for all the globetrotters, tourists, casual weekend planners etc. It provides all the facilities to the tourists for booking their vacations and holidays for either business or pleasure purposes. Moreover, the purpose is to accessorize the solution with more advanced technologies such as social media, different applications & features, advertisements etc which will mitigate the problem for both customers and the company to reach out to each other and discovering a single stop for everything with a plethora of favourable deals coming their way for the buyers.


# For the second part, you'll have to implement, all the four pages from the database itself. As in all the 14-15 images and description that you have made static, you have to made them dynamic by taking input from the admin side of django. Eg- as I showed in the presentation...where the restaurant were inserted from the admin panel.
# All will be working on their respective repositories and their respective pages like places for Muskan, Shops for Tanmay, Events for Anushree and restaurants by me. Till then I'll do the authentication part. 

# And Tanmay, make your images size same as the others.

# Deadline for this is 22th April because we still have a lot more to do.
